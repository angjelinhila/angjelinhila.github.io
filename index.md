## About Me

I am a doctoral researcher working at the intersection of **information science, computational social science, and human-AI interaction**. My research explores how socio-technical systems, emerging forms of human-AI hybrid intelligences, and algorithmic mediation produce new material ontologies that reconstitute human agency and reconfigure social action. I also develop tools for qualitative classification and large-scale discourse analysis.

I'm currently working on a set of projects that center on human agency and technology. The first dimension of this research consits of a theoretical reconceptualization of agents and the meanning of agency and situating this reconceptualization within an empirical human-comptuer interaction (HCI) context

The second dimension consists of theorizing and situating online social action within a broader theory of social action as well as individual agency. Online agency gets filtered through a continually complexifying information ecosystem where the cooperative impetus gets coopted by competing actors such as online media, search, and a broad array of cumputing services vie for information dominance.

I approach the second dimension through a hybrid of computational and manual coding methodologies on data sources that include Reddit, and other sites of online discourse that provide evidence for changing relations of sociality and foreground emerging forms of agency in light of increasing AI dominance.
